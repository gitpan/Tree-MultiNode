Revision history for Perl extension Tree::MultiNode.

1.0.8 Wed May  8 10:06:22 EDT 2002
  KRB: Papp Zoltan <padre@inf.elte.hu> pointed out a bug in
    Tree::MultiNode::Node's _clearrefs() where an array ref was
    not being dereferenced correctly.  The fix has been applied.

1.0.7 Tue Nov 13 09:00:49 EST 2001
  KRB: "Tunkelo Heikki (extern)" <Heikki.Tunkelo@erln.gepas.de> 
       subumitted a patch that fixed the select() method.

1.0.6 Wed Dec 13 11:43:11 EST 2000
  KRB: traverse was created because of comments from
          Sverrir Jonsson <Sverrir.Jonsson@net-linx-ps.com>

1.0.5 Wed Dec 13 11:32:57 EST 2000
  KRB: updated traverse so you can pass additional constant arguments
          to the sub ref.

1.0.4 Wed Dec 13 11:03:17 EST 2000
  KRB: added Tree::MultiNode::Handle::traverse as a method that takes
          a sub ref and invokes the subref for each node in the tree.

1.0.3 Thu Sep  7 11:57:14 EDT 2000
  KRB: added Tree::MultiNode::DESTROY, and Tree::MultiNode::Node::_clearrefs
          so the refcounts of the nodes, as well as the data will go to
          zero.  Eric Joanis <joanis@cs.toronto.edu> pointed out this bug,
          and sent me an example.  The chagnes are based largely on his
          work, with minor modifications.

1.0.1 Tue Nov 23 11:05:42 EST 1999
  KRB: added child_keys to the handle object to return the child
          keys from the current node.
 
1.0.1 Fri Jun  4 08:56:26 EDT 1999
  KRB: fixed print message in get_child_value() -- it should only print
          when $debug is defined...the bug was reported by 
          Kohei Ohta <kohei@cysols.com>

1.0.0 Mon May 17 11:25:51 EDT 1999
  DXP: Applied patch from Daniel X. Pape dpape@canis.uiuc.edu,
          which included:
          - Node, and Handle objects: moved tree() member function from Node 
            object to Handle object
          - Handle object:  added functionality, and member function for depth
            tracking as the Handle object is navigated through the tree.
          - Documentation for the new code.

        KRB: Added Handle::kv_pairs(), and Handle::remove_child().

        KRB: Made minor changes to the debug statements so they print the
          package name as well as the member function name - just to make
          it easier to see these messages when used in conjunction with
          other objects/packages/debugging code.
      
        KRB: Minor changes to the new() member functions, so the objects can
          be constructed in a larger variety of ways.
      
        KRB: It seemed stable enough, and failry feature complete, and there
          didn't seem like there were any more compelling reasons not to, so I
           updated the version number to 1.0.0 so it looks stable.
      
        KRB:  All previous changes made by KRB...
      
0.9.4 Wed Apr 14 12:35:01 EDT 1999
        Fixed the issue with make test, and re-released it as 0.9.4 - make test
        wasn't outputting the standard test output ("ok x").  This was sparked
        by the CPAN testers group.  Thanks.

0.9.3 Wed Nov  4 16:17:49 EST 1998
        Again, some minor bug fixes.

0.9.2 Wed Nov  4 16:17:49 EST 1998
        Some minor debugging, and added some (hopefuly useful)
        member functions.

0.9.1 Wed Oct 28 09:39:17 EST 1998 
        First release to CPAN -- 0.9.1

0.9.1 Wed Oct 28 09:39:17 EST 1998 
        Made namespace change as suggested by Andreas J. Koenig, and 
        created _alot_ more documentation.

0.9.0 Tue Oct 27 10:34:49 EST 1998
        Created Initial Version (multi_tree.pm)
