Tree::MultiNode  adpO  Multi node unordered tree objects  KRBURTON

This is an implementation of a multi node tree.  The uniqueness of
keys is not enforced, nor is there enforcement of ordering of nodes.

Tree::MultiNode was created to aid in modeling heriarchical 
relationships, like the relationships inherent in the records from
a RDBMS.  Where multi-to-multi relationships could produce multiple
child nodes with the same types or basic attributes.  Unique key
enforcement would be inappropriate in these cases (at least for me).
